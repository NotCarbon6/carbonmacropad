# Carbon's MacroPad
A 4 Key Macropad for Discord and Play/Pause Toggle with Track Skip.

### Inspiration
I wanted an compact and easily accessible way to access some discord shortcuts and also pause my media along with skipping it. Thus leading to the MacroPad.

### Challenges
The whole project was a bit of a challenge for me. It was my first time using KiCad and Fusion360. Fusion360 is much more advanced and harder to use than TinkerCad, but after getting the basics down it ended up being quite enjoyable. KiCad on the otherhand is something I need to get a better grasp on but I was able to make my PCB on it eventually.
